//This project relies heavily on both Gtkmm3 and nvtt (Nvidia Texture Toolkit)
//nvtt will need to be grabbed from the Nvidia Texture Toolkit ( https://code.google.com/p/nvidia-texture-tools/ ) and place the folder src/nvtt into the root project directory. Also make sure gtkmm3 is set up for your compiler

//Current limitations: Needs 32-bit image data, files need to stay small.

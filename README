//This project relies heavily on both Gtkmm3 and nvtt (Nvidia Texture Toolkit).
//NVTT will need to be grabbed from the Nvidia Texture Toolkit Repository ( https://code.google.com/p/nvidia-texture-tools/ )
//and the nvtt folder from src/nvtt needs to be placed in the root project directory.
//Also make sure gtkmm3 is set up for your compiler

//Current limitations: Only supports 8-bit image data (NVTT limitation), images need to be manually converted, only supports nvtt;
